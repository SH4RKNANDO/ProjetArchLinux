# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
#



#<VirtualHost *:443>
#    ServerAdmin webmaster@domainname1.dom
#    DocumentRoot "/home/user/http/domainname1.dom"
#    ServerName domainname1.dom:443
#    ServerAlias domainname1.dom:443
#    SSLEngine on
#    SSLCertificateFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server.crt"
#    SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/httpd/conf/server.key"
#    ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd/domainname1.dom-error_log"
#    CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/domainname1.dom-access_log" common
#
#    <Directory "/home/user/http/domainname1.dom">
#        Require all granted
#    </Directory>
#</VirtualHost>
